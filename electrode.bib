	abstract = {Trapped ions are among the most promising systems for practical quantum computing (QC). The basic requirements for universal QC have all been demonstrated with ions, and quantum algorithms using few-ion-qubit systems have been implemented. We review the state of the field, covering the basics of how trapped ions are used for QC and their strengths and limitations as qubits. In addition, we discuss what is being done, and what may be required, to increase the scale of trapped ion quantum computers while mitigating decoherence and control errors. Finally, we explore the outlook for trapped-ion QC. In particular, we discuss near-term applications, considerations impacting the design of future systems of trapped ions, and experiments and demonstrations that may further inform these considerations.},

	abstract = {Universal control of multiple qubits—the ability to entangle qubits and to perform arbitrary individual qubit operations1—is a fundamental resource for quantum computing2, simulation3 and networking4. Qubits realized in trapped atomic ions have shown the highest-fidelity two-qubit entangling operations5–7 and single-qubit rotations8 so far. Universal control of trapped ion qubits has been separately demonstrated using tightly focused laser beams9–12 or by moving ions with respect to laser beams13–15, but at lower fidelities. Laser-free entangling methods16–20 may offer improved scalability by harnessing microwave technology developed for wireless communications, but so far their performance has lagged the best reported laser-based approaches. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity laser-free universal control of two trapped-ion qubits by creating both symmetric and antisymmetric maximally entangled states with fidelities of \$\$\{1\}\_\{-0.0017\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0\}\$\$and \$\$\{0.9977\}\_\{-0.0013\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0010\}\$\$, respectively (68 per cent confidence level), corrected for initialization error. We use a scheme based on radiofrequency magnetic field gradients combined with microwave magnetic fields that is robust against multiple sources of decoherence and usable with essentially any trapped ion species. The scheme has the potential to perform simultaneous entangling operations on multiple pairs of ions in a large-scale trapped-ion quantum processor without increasing control signal power or complexity. Combining this technology with low-power laser light delivered via trap-integrated photonics21,22 and trap-integrated photon detectors for qubit readout23,24 provides an opportunity for scalable, high-fidelity, fully chip-integrated trapped-ion quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Realizing a long coherence time quantum memory is a major challenge of current quantum technology. Until now, the longest coherence-time of a single qubit was reported as 660 s in a single 171Yb+ ion-qubit through the technical developments of sympathetic cooling and dynamical decoupling pulses, which addressed heating-induced detection inefficiency and magnetic field fluctuations. However, it was not clear what prohibited further enhancement. Here, we identify and suppress the limiting factors, which are the remaining magnetic-field fluctuations, frequency instability and leakage of the microwave reference-oscillator. Then, we observe the coherence time of around 5500 s for the 171Yb+ ion-qubit, which is the time constant of the exponential decay fit from the measurements up to 960 s. We also systematically study the decoherence process of the quantum memory by using quantum process tomography and analyze the results by applying recently developed resource theories of quantum memory and coherence. Our experimental demonstration will accelerate practical applications of quantum memories for various quantum information processing, especially in the noisy-intermediate-scale quantum regime.},

	abstract = {Helmholtz coils have extensive applications in biological medicine, aerospace, and other industries depending on the simple structure and miraculous magnetic field characteristics. However, the uniform zone generated by them is not appropriate for scientific experiments with large devices. Due to the limitations of Helmholtz coils in application, a novel design technique is proposed to improve the homogeneity and region of magnetic field. The main approach is to add an auxiliary coil on each side of Helmholtz coils to compensate for the magnetic field that exists farther out from the center point. To analyze the size relationship between the auxiliary coil and the main coil to obtain the best magnetic field distribution, the traditional Maclaurin expansion method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are used to research and discuss. The magnetic field distribution and the corresponding effective coverage rate (ECR) of the improved schemes with different structural parameters are calculated under the relative deviations of 0.1\%, 0.5\% and 1\%, respectively. The results obtained by the above optimization methods are verified by the finite element software COMSOL and specific experiments. Both optimization methods manifest that the maximum effective coverage rate can be achieved when the size of the auxiliary coil is consistent with that of the main coil. In addition, we compare the improved four-coil structure proposed in this paper with the existing four-coil square structure under the same volume. The data show that the improved structure has certain advantages in the spatial magnetic field distribution. The corresponding tri-axial coil system is established by adopting the parameters on the single axis, which can achieve a constant magnetic field in arbitrary directions by controlling the magnitude and direction of current on each axis. This provides a theoretical basis for the application of magnetic navigation technology.},

	abstract = {Using the Helmholtz coils system is one of the most suitable approaches which have been introduced for generating uniform magnetic fields. In this paper, uniformity of the generated magnetic field by a practical one-dimensional (1D) Helmholtz coils system has been analyzed, mathematically. For this purpose, relationships between the magnetic field uniformity and different practical unavoidable mismatches have been extracted. The theoretical analysis clearly demonstrates the effect of assembly misalignments and manufacturing mismatches on the magnetic field achieved by a practical 1D Helmholtz coils system. The given analyses have been confirmed by the experimental results which are in good agreement with the calculated values. This analysis and the experimental results illustrate that to achieve a very high uniform magnetic field, practical assembly misalignments, and manufacturing mismatches must be as small as possible, and the background magnetic field distortion must be avoided, too. The results of this work are important in the design of instruments and systems where Helmholtz coils are used.},

Although the elementary requirements for quantum computation have been demonstrated in this system, there exist theoretical and technical obstacles to scaling up the approach to large numbers of qubits. Therefore, recent efforts have been concentrated on using quantum communication to link a number of small ion-trap quantum systems. Developing the array-based approach, we show how to achieve massively parallel gate operation in a large-scale quantum computer, based on techniques already demonstrated for manipulating small quantum registers. The use of decoherence-free subspaces significantly reduces decoherence during ion transport, and removes the requirement of clock synchronization between the interaction regions.},

	abstract = {The use of adjustable magnetic field sources is becoming an indispensable necessity in numerous applications. In particular, permanent magnet assemblies, such as the rod mangle design, avoid the large power consumption and Joule heating problems present in electromagnets. In this work, we present a systematic 2D study of rod mangle configurations with different number of rods. We observe that the magnetic field homogeneity increases with the number of used rods and, for a sufficiently large number, the behavior of the assembly is similar to that of a perfect Halbach. Generally, the rotation of only one rod changes the direction and decreases the homogeneity and magnitude of the magnetic field. Nevertheless, the impact of such rotation reduces with the increase of the number of rods in the system. We also study how different rotation patterns influence the generated magnetic field and demonstrate how one can: (i) reduce the magnetic field magnitude rotating its direction; (ii) reduce the magnetic field magnitude keeping its direction constant; (iii) invert the magnetic field direction, after being reduced; or (iv) rotate the magnetic field direction keeping its magnitude constant. These results are similar to those obtained by a nested Halbach. In addition to the low cost, the results show that the mangle system is highly versatile, can be easily manipulated and, consequently, has a large application potential. The magnetic model was successfully validated with experimental systems of three and four rods.},

	abstract = {Practical and useful quantum information processing requires substantial improvements with respect to current systems, both in the error rates of basic operations and in scale. The fundamental qualities of individual trapped-ion1 qubits are promising for long-term systems2, but the optics involved in their precise control are a barrier to scaling3. Planar-fabricated optics integrated within ion-trap devices can make such systems simultaneously more robust and parallelizable, as suggested by previous work with single ions4. Here we use scalable optics co-fabricated with a surface-electrode ion trap to achieve high-fidelity multi-ion quantum logic gates, which are often the limiting elements in building up the precise, large-scale entanglement that is essential to quantum computation. Light is efficiently delivered to a trap chip in a cryogenic environment via direct fibre coupling on multiple channels, eliminating the need for beam alignment into vacuum systems and cryostats and lending robustness to vibrations and beam-pointing drifts. This allows us to perform ground-state laser cooling of ion motion and to implement gates generating two-ion entangled states with fidelities greater than 99.3(2) per cent. This work demonstrates hardware that reduces noise and drifts in sensitive quantum logic, and simultaneously offers a route to practical parallelization for high-fidelity quantum processors5. Similar devices may also find applications in atom- and ion-based quantum sensing and timekeeping6.},

Near-square hysteresis loops and large values of the coercivity and anisotropy fields greatly simplify magnet design, as each magnet block is effectively transparent to the magnetic fields produced elsewhere in the magnet assembly. The fields generated by compact and efficient magnet structures requiring no continuous expenditure of energy can be static or variable, uniform or nonuniform. Permanent magnets are fully competitive with electromagnets for fields up to 2T, and fields as high as to 5T can be produced in a small volume. When a field with a rapid spatial variation is required, permanent magnets may offer the only practicable solution. Both permanent magnet structures and the uses to which they are put are reviewed, classifying the magnet applications in terms of the nature of the field, the effect on the magnet and the physical effect exploited.},

	abstract = {Permanent magnet arrays offer several attributes attractive for the development of a low-cost portable MRI scanner for brain imaging. They offer the potential for a relatively lightweight, low to mid-field system with no cryogenics, a small fringe field, and no electrical power requirements or heat dissipation needs. The cylindrical Halbach array, however, requires external shimming or mechanical adjustments to produce B0 fields with standard MRI homogeneity levels (e.g., 0.1 ppm over FOV), particularly when constrained or truncated geometries are needed, such as a head-only magnet where the magnet length is constrained by the shoulders. For portable scanners using rotation of the magnet for spatial encoding with generalized projections, the spatial pattern of the field is important since it acts as the encoding field. In either a static or rotating magnet, it will be important to be able to optimize the field pattern of cylindrical Halbach arrays in a way that retains construction simplicity. To achieve this, we present a method for designing an optimized cylindrical Halbach magnet using the genetic algorithm to achieve either homogeneity (for standard MRI applications) or a favorable spatial encoding field pattern (for rotational spatial encoding applications). We compare the chosen designs against a standard, fully populated sparse Halbach design, and evaluate optimized spatial encoding fields using point-spread-function and image simulations. We validate the calculations by comparing to the measured field of a constructed magnet. The experimentally implemented design produced fields in good agreement with the predicted fields, and the genetic algorithm was successful in improving the chosen metrics. For the uniform target field, an order of magnitude homogeneity improvement was achieved compared to the un-optimized, fully populated design. For the rotational encoding design the resolution uniformity is improved by 95\% compared to a uniformly populated design.},

The latter is then solved by combining differential evolution algorithms with magnet shape variation based on analytical computations of the field. The proposed formalism is then applied to study possible realizations of continuous three-axis joystick motion tracking, realized with just a single magnet and a single 3D magnetic field sensor. The computations show that this is possible when a specific design condition is fulfilled and that large state separations as high as 1mT/∘ can be achieved under realistic conditions. Finally, a comparison to state-of-the-art design methods is drawn, computation accuracy is reviewed critically, and an experimental validation is presented.},

Therefore, they are suitable for high comfort applications. However, if during the manufacturing process assembling errors are made or the manufacturing tolerances are not properly set, the ideal conceptual high comfort characteristics could not be achieved. Hence, in this paper an error in the magnetization process caused by an incorrect alignment of the magnetizer is studied. Demagnetized magnets are placed in the rotor and then a magnetizer magnetizes them. Due to an excessive tolerance alignment of the magnetizer, not all the magnets are equally magnetized neither each magnet is homogeneously magnetized. In the paper the failure pattern is analyzed, and the performance of the machine is studied by Finite Element Analysis and experimentally. The results show a significant reduction of the comfort and a higher current consumption.},

This paper proposes a systematic method by which the effect of design specification variations on permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machine performance may be identified and quantified. The method combines design of experiments techniques, open-circuit and short-circuit physical measurements, and virtual test simulations conducted based on the recently approved IEEE Std 1812 testing guide. Three case studies, two provided by a spoke-type PM radial field machine configuration, in two designs with different electromagnetic loading, and an axial flux PM machine are discussed. It is shown that based on the output performance, out of specification tolerances for magnet remanence, steel grade, as well as dimensional variables, and stator to rotor eccentricity, may be identified under certain conditions. It is also exemplified that the ratings, magnetic loading, and configuration of the machine play critical roles and should be thoroughly considered as part of the studies.},

	abstract = {One of the most promising suggested applications of quantum computing is solving classically intractable chemistry problems. This may help to answer unresolved questions about phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity, solid-state physics, transition metal catalysis, and certain biochemical reactions. In turn, this increased understanding may help us to refine, and perhaps even one day design, new compounds of scientific and industrial importance. However, building a sufficiently large quantum computer will be a difficult scientific challenge. As a result, developments that enable these problems to be tackled with fewer quantum resources should be considered important. Driven by this potential utility, quantum computational chemistry is rapidly emerging as an interdisciplinary field requiring knowledge of both quantum computing and computational chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to both computational chemistry and quantum computing, bridging the current knowledge gap. Major developments in this area are reviewed, with a particular focus on near-term quantum computation. Illustrations of key methods are provided, explicitly demonstrating how to map chemical problems onto a quantum computer, and how to solve them. The review concludes with an outlook on this nascent field.},

	abstract = {The representation and storage of two-electron integral tensors are vital in large-scale applications of accurate electronic structure methods. Low-rank representation and efficient storage strategy of integral tensors can significantly reduce the numerical overhead and consequently time-to-solution of these methods. In this work, by combining pivoted incomplete Cholesky decomposition (CD) with a follow-up truncated singular vector decomposition (SVD), we develop a decomposition strategy to approximately represent the two-electron integral tensor in terms of low-rank vectors. A systematic benchmark test on a series of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D carbon–hydrogen systems demonstrates high efficiency and scalability of the compound two-step decomposition of the two-electron integral tensor in our implementation. For the size of the atomic basis set, Nb, ranging from ∼100 up to ∼2,000, the observed numerical scaling of our implementation shows O(Nb2.5−3) versus O(Nb3−4) cost of performing single CD on the two-electron integral tensor in most of the other implementations. More importantly, this decomposition strategy can significantly reduce the storage requirement of the atomic orbital (AO) two-electron integral tensor from O(Nb4) to O(Nb2⁡log(Nb)) with moderate decomposition thresholds. The accuracy tests have been performed using ground- and excited-state formulations of coupled cluster formalism employing single and double excitations (CCSD) on several benchmark systems including the C60 molecule described by nearly 1,400 basis functions. The results show that the decomposition thresholds can be generally set to 10–4 to 10–3 to give acceptable compromise between efficiency and accuracy.},

	abstract = {The anticipated applications of quantum computers span across science and industry, ranging from quantum chemistry and many-body physics to optimization, finance, and machine learning. Proposed quantum solutions in these areas typically combine multiple quantum algorithmic primitives into an overall quantum algorithm, which must then incorporate the methods of quantum error correction and fault tolerance to be implemented correctly on quantum hardware. As such, it can be difficult to assess how much a particular application benefits from quantum computing, as the various approaches are often sensitive to intricate technical details about the underlying primitives and their complexities. Here we present a survey of several potential application areas of quantum algorithms and their underlying algorithmic primitives, carefully considering technical caveats and subtleties. We outline the challenges and opportunities in each area in an "end-to-end" fashion by clearly defining the problem being solved alongside the input-output model, instantiating all "oracles," and spelling out all hidden costs. We also compare quantum solutions against state-of-the-art classical methods and complexity-theoretic limitations to evaluate possible quantum speedups. The survey is written in a modular, wiki-like fashion to facilitate navigation of the content. Each primitive and application area is discussed in a standalone section, with its own bibliography of references and embedded hyperlinks that direct to other relevant sections. This structure mirrors that of complex quantum algorithms that involve several layers of abstraction, and it enables rapid evaluation of how end-to-end complexities are impacted when subroutines are altered.},

The ac electric field that causes the micromotion may also induce significant Stark shifts in atomic transitions. We describe three methods of detecting micromotion. The first relies on the change of the average ion position as the trap potentials are changed. The second monitors the amplitude of the sidebands of a narrow atomic transition, caused by the first-order Doppler shift due to the micromotion. The last technique detects the Doppler shift induced modulation of the fluorescence rate of a broad atomic transition. We discuss the detection sensitivity of each method to Doppler and Stark shifts, and show experimental results using the last technique.},
